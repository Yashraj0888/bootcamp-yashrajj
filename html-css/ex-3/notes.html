            <p>In my experience, working with classless CSS has been a unique and interesting challenge. The primary benefit is the simplicity of not needing to assign classes or IDs to each element on the page. This leads to faster prototyping and a more minimalist approach to styling.</p>
            <h3>Links to Solution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="solution-1.html" target="_blank">Solution 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="solution-2.html" target="_blank">Solution 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="solution-3.html" target="_blank">Solution 3</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Customization:</strong> Without classes or IDs, it becomes more difficult to target specific elements for custom styling. The default styles might not always match the design vision, which can lead to compromises.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Reusability:</strong> Classless CSS is great for one-off pages but doesn’t work well for complex layouts that need reusable components.</li>
                <li><strong>Overriding Styles:</strong> In some cases, the default styles provided by classless CSS may conflict with the specific look and feel I want to achieve, requiring extra work to override them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Benefits of Classless CSS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The main advantage is the simplicity it offers. You don’t have to manage many classes, and you can focus purely on the structure of the HTML.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Codebase:</strong> By avoiding classes, the codebase becomes much cleaner, which leads to easier maintenance in the long run.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> Classless CSS allows for better readability since you’re not distracted by class names, making the HTML easier to read.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Classless CSS is perfect for quick projects or simple web pages. However, for larger, more complex websites or applications that require intricate layouts, using classes and IDs might be a better approach to ensure flexibility and maintainability. It's all about the trade-off between simplicity and control.</p>
